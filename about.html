				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>We're a relatively new company but we have a team that has been doing web design for years on end. On top of that we have a team of graphics designers that will make sure to give you a wow factor when you look at your website. Okay we're out of words now and we're just writing for the sake of it. Actually it's me, one person pretending to be a team. But this beats dummy text, doesn't it?</p>
				<p class="dark">So I want this section to be highlighted in a dark kinda thing because it's cool and you agree with me which is what makes you a special person, very agreeable indeed, I shall not forget this ;) I'mma be honest with you, I'm really struggling with the urge to add dummy text, my creativity is about to fail me, who would have thought that just writing random whether coherent or incoherent stuff that pops up in your brain would be this tough? By the way while you're at it, take the time to appreciate just how much I've wasted your time reading all this yet you can attest to being entertained LOL. Okay I think that's enough. Bye now. I said bye. Please move on. PS: You will never get these minutes of your life back muhahahaha.</p>

					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>Pretend that we offer website designing services while we...I am actually just learning this stuff. Which is interesting cause I thought it would be quite tough but my expectations have been subverted.</p>
